# Texas Hold Em
This project is a Java program which simulates a game of Texas Hold 'Em with a given number of players. The program deals two cards objects to each player in the game and finds the highest order hand for each player. It then calculates the game's winner based on the hand rank and kickers (ie: tiebreakers when the hand ranks are equal).
# How to run the program
Downloading the classes and running the GamePlayer class with the latest Java Standard Edition Development Kit will allow simulations to be run.
